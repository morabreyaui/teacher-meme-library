// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// 20 real meme formats with per-format text zones.
//
// Each format defines:
//   - dimensions of the source image (so we know the canvas to paint)
//   - "zones": named text slots with positions (as fractions of image
//     w/h), max box size, alignment, and style. The agentic caption
//     generator fills these slots; the renderer paints them in place.
//   - "exampleCaptions": at least 5 baked-in teacher captions per format.
//     They double as a fallback when the LLM is unavailable AND as
//     few-shot examples for the prompt.
//
// Style keys recognized by the renderer:
//   - "caption":     Impact, ALL CAPS, white fill + heavy black stroke.
//                    Sits on top of photography (default).
//   - "dark-on-light": Impact, original case, black fill, no stroke.
//                    Used for Drake / Expanding Brain panels where the
//                    background is already a flat cream color.
//   - "mocking":     Impact, mIxEd cAsE, black fill, no stroke.
//   - "sign":        Impact, ALL CAPS, dark fill on cream sign.
//   - "doge":        Comic Sans MS, lowercase, colored fill, thin black stroke.
